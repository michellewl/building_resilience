### Choose a server (sci1-sci6)
ssh -X jasmin-sci2
```
After login, run:

```
git clone https://github.com/michellewl/building_resilience.git
```

To setup enviornment run from Jasmin terminal:

```
cd building_resilience/data/bias_correction/jasmin/setup

sh setup.sh

```
** Discover what is Jaspy for [here](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article/4729-jaspy-envs)


Run:

```
sh ../building_resilience/data/bias_correction/jasmin/setup/create_directories_climate_models.sh
```


For creating csv files for the ERA data with threshold of 24cËš run:

```
sh ../building_resilience/data/bias_correction/jasmin/bjobs/era_bjob.sh
```  
- The csv files produced will have to grid point with its associated Cooling Degree Days (CDD)

To check the status of the job:

```
bjobs -a
```

After the jobs are done run: 

```
sh ../building_resilience/data/bias_correction/jasmin/setup/mv_era_files.sh
```
