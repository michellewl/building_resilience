AI4ER Guided Team Challenge: Team 1 (Future demand for cooling &amp; heating of buildings in future climate scenarios)

## Background
It is generally accepted that the current climate crisis will result in an increased future global average temperature. However, at a higher spatial resolution, some parts of the globe may experience higher or lower temperatures to greater extremes. This project aims to investigate how the changing future climate will impact the energy demand of buildings, attributed to cooling and/or heating.
