AI4ER Guided Team Challenge: Team 1 (Future demand for cooling &amp; heating of buildings in future climate scenarios)

## Background
It is generally accepted that the current climate crisis will result in an increased future global average temperature. However, at a higher spatial resolution, some parts of the globe may experience higher or lower temperatures to greater extremes. This project aims to investigate how the changing future climate will impact the energy demand of buildings, attributed to cooling and/or heating.

## Our approach
Ideal data would have high spatio-temporal resolution, enabling the mapping of weather data to building energy usage. Unfortunately, such data is not widely available (and may not exist). With this in mind, we approach this problem from two key directions: top-down and bottom-up.
Climate/weather data is readily available from global climate models (GCMs) but require bias correction before they can be used in further analysis.

#### Top-down approach

#### Bottom-up approach
This approach uses available building energy data for a number of anonymised sites in developed countries. These datasets have good temporal resolution e.g. hourly or daily, and are good candidates for development of machine learning models. Here, we investigate a number of different ML approaches:
- Linear regression (baseline model)
- Neural networks
- Gaussian processes
- Random Forests
- XG Boost
