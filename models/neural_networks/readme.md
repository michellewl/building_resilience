## Neural networks for predictive modelling of time series building energy data
Neural networks have been established as the best ML methods for predictions with commercial buildings at high temporal resolutions (Edwards et al., 2012). A feed forward neural network (FFNN) is coded here with scripts for training and evaluation (assessment). Common industry metrics (Amasyali & El-Gohary, 2018) are reported in the assessment script.

#### ML Python libraries
Both Sci-Kit Learn and PyTorch examples are included here.
##### Sci-Kit Learn
The sklearn library enables beginner-level coding of some machine learning models, including FFNNs. It was used at the beginning of this project and is a recommended first port of call.
##### PyTorch
